# Hot Dog detector with Machin learning models and Flask

Use Flask Framework and Machine learning models from Hugging Face API repository to create a Hot Dog dectector. 


## Setup ðŸ’»

Create a virtual env and open a new terminal to install all of the dependencies project running the following:

### Install Flask Framework


```bash

python -m pip install flask


```

### Install Dotenv library
 
```bash

pip install python-dotenv

```

### Install Requests library
 
```bash

pip install requests

```

### Now run this project 

```bash

python3 web.py

```


## Goal of this project? ðŸ’¡

* Use Machine learning models for our App logic. In this case Hugging Face has a set of models than we can use with tokens

* Learn to use Python with Flask framework to Query APIs and route them to our web application front-end and get validate the images files


## Use this as a boiler plate to detect other types of objects

You can train your own Machine learning models and integrate them using this detector boilerplate or you could search for other models that can be used to detect if the images is correct or not.
